# collections.abc is a module from the standard Python library providing abstract base classes \
# for the common objects we use daily in Python: iterators, generators, callables, sets, mappings, and so on. \
# They are mainly useful in advanced use cases where we need to implement new custom objects \
# that should behave like an iterator, generator, and so on. Here, we only use them as type hints.
